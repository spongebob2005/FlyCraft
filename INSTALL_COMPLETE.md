|-----|-----------|----------|-----------|-------|
| **V** | Wave | 1.0s | Sparkle | Greeting gesture |

---

## 🚀 How to Use

### For Players
1. Launch Minecraft with the mod
2. Press animation keybinds during gameplay:
   - **V** = Wave
   - **C** = Clap
   - **B** = Dance
   - **X** = Spin
   - **Z** = Jump Boost
3. Customize keys in `Settings → Controls → Movement`

### For Developers

#### Creating a New Animation (Step-by-step)

**Step 1:** Create animation class
```java
public class MyAnimation extends Animation {
    private PlayerModel<?> model;
    
    public MyAnimation(float duration, AbstractClientPlayer player, PlayerModel<?> model) {
        super(duration, false); // false=once, true=loop
        this.model = model;
    }
    
    @Override
    protected void onUpdate(float progress) {
        float eased = easeProgress(EasingFunction.Easing.EASE_OUT);
        model.rightArm.xRot = eased * 1.5f;
    }
}
```

**Step 2:** Register animation in `AnimationController.java`:
```java
AnimationManager.registerAnimation("myanimation", 
    new MyAnimation(1.0f, player, model));
```

**Step 3:** Add keybind in `AnimationKeybinds.java`:
```java
public static final KeyMapping MY_KEY = new KeyMapping(
    "key.flycraft.myanimation",
    GLFW.GLFW_KEY_N,
    "key.categories.movement"
);
```

**Step 4:** Handle input in `ClientEvents.java`:
```java
if (AnimationKeybinds.MY_KEY.consumeClick()) {
    AnimationController.playAnimation("myanimation");
    ParticleEffects.sparkleEffect(player, 10);
}
```

**Step 5:** Add localization in `en_us.json`:
```json
"key.flycraft.myanimation": "My Animation"
```

See `ANIMATION_EXAMPLES.md` for 7 ready-to-use animation templates!

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### Animations not showing?
- Check keybind is registered in `KeybindHandler.registerKeys()`
- Verify animation name matches in `ClientEvents`
- Check console for error messages

### Particles not visible?
- Ensure player is in creative/survival mode
- Check particle rendering is enabled in settings
- Verify `MC` instance in `ParticleEffects`

### Keybind conflicts?
- Change key in `AnimationKeybinds.java`
- Check Minecraft settings for conflicts
- Use different GLFW key constants

### Performance issues?
- Reduce particle count in `ParticleEffects`
- Simplify animation logic
- Profile with F3+L in-game
